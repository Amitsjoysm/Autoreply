# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Fix OAuth Google email account integration, auto-reply functionality, and calendar event creation issues.
  User reported: "when i click on oauth google i see no details found" and issues with auto replies and calendar events not getting created.

backend:
  - task: "OAuth Token Refresh Logic"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "services/email_service.py, services/calendar_service.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: true
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: |
          Added ensure_token_valid() method to both EmailService and CalendarService.
          This checks if OAuth tokens are expired and automatically refreshes them before API calls.
          Uses python-dateutil to parse ISO format dates and refresh tokens via OAuthService.
          Updates database with new tokens after refresh.
  
  - task: "OAuth Authorization Endpoints"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "routes/oauth_routes.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: true
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: |
          Added missing /oauth/google/authorize and /oauth/microsoft/authorize endpoints.
          Frontend was trying to access /authorize but backend only had /url endpoint.
          New endpoints extract user from JWT token, create state, and redirect to OAuth provider.
          Also added GET handler for /oauth/google/callback to handle redirect from Google.
          Callback now redirects back to frontend with success/error query params.
  
  - task: "Auto-Reply Logic"
    implemented: true
    working: "NA"
    file: "workers/email_worker.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"

        comment: |
          Auto-reply logic was already implemented in email_worker.py lines 179-208.
          It requires: 1) Intent with auto_send=true flag, 2) Valid draft, 3) Valid OAuth tokens.
          With token refresh now working, auto-replies should work if intents are configured properly.
          Needs testing with real email accounts and intents configured.
  
  - task: "Calendar Event Creation"
    implemented: true
    working: "NA"

          Calendar event creation logic in email_worker.py lines 123-159.
          Requires: 1) Calendar provider connected, 2) Meeting detected with confidence > threshold, 3) Valid OAuth tokens.
          With token refresh now working, calendar creation should work if calendar provider is connected.
          Needs testing with real email accounts and calendar providers.

        comment: |
          Added useSearchParams to handle success/error query parameters from OAuth callback.
          Shows toast notification when user returns from OAuth flow.
          Clears URL parameters after showing notification.

      Fixed OAuth integration issues:
      
      ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:
      1. Missing /oauth/google/authorize endpoint - frontend called non-existent endpoint
      2. No token expiry checking - tokens expired after 1 hour causing API failures
      3. No automatic token refresh - refresh_token was stored but never used
      4. Frontend tried to redirect to /authorize without auth headers - browser redirects don't include auth headers
      
      FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
      1. Updated frontend to use /oauth/google/url API endpoint (with auth headers) to get OAuth URL
      2. Frontend now redirects to the OAuth URL returned by the API
      3. Added ensure_token_valid() method to EmailService and CalendarService
      4. Token refresh automatically happens before Gmail/Calendar API calls
      5. Frontend now shows success/error messages from OAuth callback
      6. Backend redirects to frontend with query params after OAuth
      7. /oauth/google/url now accepts account_type parameter (email or calendar)
      
      CHANGES IN THIS UPDATE:
      - EmailAccounts.js: Changed handleOAuthConnect to async, now calls API.getGoogleOAuthUrl()
      - CalendarProviders.js: Changed handleConnectGoogle to async, now calls API with account_type=calendar
      - oauth_routes.py: Updated /oauth/google/url to accept account_type parameter
      - Removed unused /oauth/google/authorize and /oauth/microsoft/authorize endpoints
      
      SERVICES STATUS:
      ✅ Backend: Running (pid 3011)
      ✅ Frontend: Running (pid 3039)
      ✅ MongoDB: Running (pid 2606)
      ✅ Redis: Running and connected
      ✅ Background workers: Active (polling emails, follow-ups, reminders)
      
      NEXT STEPS FOR USER:
      1. Try connecting Gmail account via OAuth - should now work!
      2. Set up intents with auto_send=true for auto-replies
      3. Connect calendar provider for calendar event creation
      4. Send test emails to verify auto-reply and calendar creation
      
      NOTE: Auto-replies and calendar events require:
      - OAuth tokens (now working with auto-refresh)
      - Intents configured with auto_send flag
      - Calendar provider connected for calendar features
